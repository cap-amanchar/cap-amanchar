### About Me 🚀

I'm a tech enthusiast since I was a kid, always eager to explore computers and tech gadgets. I used to skip classes just to stay home and learn how to crack open and modify the software and hardware of my devices. It's no wonder I ended up diving deep into the world of web development!

### 🌐 Web QA Engineer 🌐
